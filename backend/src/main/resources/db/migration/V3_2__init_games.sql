You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...

Portal 2''s core mechanics are very similar to the first game''s ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.

The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.

Portal 2 also features a co-op mode where two players take on the roles of robots being led through tests by GladOS, as well as an in-depth level editor.', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/games/2ba/2bac0e87cf45e5b508f227d281c9252a.jpg', true, false, NULL);

Survivors can form one- to six-person Tribes with the options to choose Unofficial and Official (Ranked) servers, and a variety of game-lengths and sizes in which to play.

Balanced for intense competition, contestants begin in a neutral staging area where they can communicate pre-game, strategize, or talk trash. After a count-down, they dramatically descend from the sky onto the ARK in a circular formation via beams of light. There is a cache of valuable items in the center – do survivors dash for the goods and fight it out, do they run into the forest and hide, search for Dinosaurs to rapidly build their army, or do they freeze up from the sheer terror of death? A continually shrinking “ring of death” forces contestants ever closer together over time. The hunt is on!

A samurai from the rival Ashina clan captured the protagonist''s master, and the protagonist himself lost his arm trying to protect his leader. However, a sculptor of Buddha statues managed to replace the lost limb with an advanced prosthetic arm. The protagonist accepted a new name, Sekiro, meaning “one-armed wolf”.

###Plot
The events of Assassin''s Creed Odyssey''s take place in the Classical Era of Ancient Greece, in 431 BC, before the Brotherhood of Assassins was even formed.

The atomic bombing left many parts of the Earth''s surface uninhabitable due to high radiation rates, dangerous mutated monsters, and anomalies abound.

Batman himself does not use any weapons due to his moral choices while the enemies grow stronger and begin using different weaponry as the game progresses.

In some cases, while confronting a group of enemies, it is suggested that Batman''s actions should not be spotted and the game turns into a stealth action.', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/games/d56/d564ee964eb3c17892b3b35dd607f836.jpg', true, false, NULL);

###Plot
Like the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.

###Gameplay
Battlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player''s interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.
The game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.

###Modes
Battlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/games/45b/45b57ed59de4b84effd8f6bc4b7bf515.jpg', true, false, NULL);

While being not so demanding on a software side, it was released on the mobile platforms as well as on the big consoles. Such variety of platforms, however, limits the gameplay peculiarities that can be featured within a game.
The player takes a role of one of four characters on the Belgian, American, French and German side of the Great War conflict — World War I. During the game they need to solve puzzles, watch animated cutscenes, fight enemies and do military races.
Valiant Hearts is thus telling four stories simultaneously and ties them up in the end and throughout a fabula, while being historically correct when it is crucial.

The differences between Battlefront II and Battlefront mainly relate to increasing the number of game modes (campaign, galaxy conquest, instant action, challenges and multiplayer), the ability to play for different heroes and villains, the presence of the ability to sprint and to flip ahead.

Throughout the game, there is a battle between two armies. But the action can be different (it all depends on the selected mode and version of the game).

A unique set of digitized board games from the Berserk Games studio. The studio successfully raised funds for development in 2014 at Kickstarter and released the project in the same year. Only two people worked on the game: they just graduated from college and had some experience developing game mods. The game uses the Unity graphics engine and is available on Steam for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and OS X.

###Game mechanics
There are no conditions for victory or defeat in the game. Each time players simply spawn on the playing field, where they can interact freely with game figures and pieces. All the craziness occurs within the realistic physical model, which the developers have added for greater similarity to the real prototypes. In addition to the insanity that can be arranged in multiplayer along with ten other players, the game engine supports the ability to use preset rules for different board games and thus play them.

###Key features
There are several games included. For example, chess, poker, and checkers. The set is small, but the game supports Steam Workshop and the ability to download your own models of figures and game boards. Thus, players added to the standard set of three games three thousand more variations, most of which are variations on games, for the inclusion of which developers will have to purchase a license.', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/games/f86/f869253c68b38fa789f58cc5be2cb996.jpg', true, false, NULL);

Released in 2016, the remastered version of one of the most revolutionary parts of the annual Call of Duty series. In 2007, the series moved from historical scenery to modern, got a new more advanced graphics thanks to the freshly-released consoles and presented to the players a hardcore fast-paced multiplayer. The latter is still wanted by hardcore fans, which gave the publisher Activision Blizzard a reason to remaster the game.

###Key features
In the new version, developers from the Raven Software did their best to rebuild the experience (the original game was developed by Infinity Ward). The game is available for purchase, as a separate product, and as part of a bundle. Owners of the original version of the game can get Remastered for free - you need to have the original disk for this or digital purchase. The re-released game did not change the gameplay in any way: it is still a fast-paced first-person shooter. The story campaign, during which the player takes control of several characters, also has not changed. Most of the changes turned out to be cosmetic and allowed the new studio to add new technologies to the original game: for example, while prone and moving, the weapon touching the ground will vibrate the controller. Also in the single-player campaign, new cheat codes were added, such as exaggerated physics and the ability to replace heads on the shoulders of virtual people with watermelons.

###The changes
The main changes lie in multiplayer, which pulled up to the standard of modern games of the series. In place, there were the same modes, the same weapons, and perks. Added new ones, like the Prop Hunt mode, in which players turn into nonliving objects and hide on the map.

###Plot
The plot of the game is identical to that of the three original games. They all follow Spyro, a small cutesy purple dragon, on his quest to save his dragon kin from various villains.

The games are set in the Dragon Kingdom, a fantasy world inhabited by sentient dragons. There are five dragon realms that used to co-exist peacefully. In the first game, the villain is Gnasty Gnorc (a gnome/orc half-blood), who magically turned all dragons into crystals. Spyro has to save them and defeat Gnorc. In the sequels, Spyro has to deal with other villains, such as Ripto the warlock, who tries to conquer the world, or Sorceress, who steals the dragons'' eggs.

###Gameplay
The player controls Spyro in a 3D environment from the third person view. Spyro can breathe fire to defeat his enemies. The dragon cannot actually fly, but he can glide long distances. A dragonfly companion named Sparx follows Spyro, helping him to pick up treasures and keep track of his health. To restore his health, Spyro can eat butterflies.

Here is a sandbox like no other. Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don''t recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!
The Technology:
Unfortunately there really aren''t many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn''t stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it''s true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it''s surroundings and effects the overall lighting.
Yes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/2a2/2a2a162a08f2bba053334ecfda25228d.jpg', true, false, 79);

The plot of the game is in no way connected with the previous part, except for the time when events unfold: a day after the events of the previous game. In this iteration, Cartman and the children decide to dress up as superheroes and create their mega-popular franchise, like Marvel. The player joins the action as before in the role of the The New Kid and becomes a witness in the adventures of Cartman and the team.

The main theme of the game - survival during a zombie apocalypse.

It has an open and changing world, many opportunities for the manufacture of useful things and cooperation with other characters, to fight hunger, injuries, depression and paranoia.

###Plot
The game takes place in Knox County, Kentucky, USA.

As a result of the epidemic, a huge part of the population of the district became infected with an unknown virus and turned into a zombie. The few survivors will have to fight for survival.

The player plays as one of the survivors. The game does not have any definite ending, it cannot be won and it will end when the player’s character dies - and it depends only on him how late it will happen.

###Gameplay
The game begins with the creation of a character.

The player can choose the name, gender, race, hairstyle, initial clothing, as well as the presence of a beard and chest hair in a male character.

Then begins the creation of character and part of the background of the character. You can choose the character''s profession before the apocalypse. Subsequently, this will affect some of the skills (for example, a former policeman shoots better, a builder builds defenses better, nurses heal wounds more successfully, cooks cook better, etc.).

You can then choose the positive and negative traits of the character. The negative ones include obesity, laziness, poor eyesight, chronic fatigue, constant thirst, etc. For the chosen negative traits you get points - these points can be spent on the positive traits of this character, such as agility, strength, high disease resistance and even luck.

After creating a character, you (or rather, a character) find yourself in a randomly selected house on a game map. The zombie apocalypse has already begun, and your character has to look for a way to survive. In the game, not even very moral ways are allowed to do this: you can loot and rob, you can create a group of honest people and resist both zombies and bandits.

In addition to winning battles, the hero needs food, water, sleep, rest, and fellowship to survive - constant loneliness can lead to depression.

The complexity of the game increases constantly and gradually - the activity of zombies increases, electricity and water supply are turned off, and the products deteriorate. However, the player is able to provide a lot for himself - to cook food on a fire, collect rainwater, grow food.

However, no action can ensure eternal survival - sooner or later the character dies. The slogan at the beginning of each new game is pessimistic: “This is the story of your death.”', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/243/2436b84b99f1121c302367f0c5901b84.jpg', true, false, NULL);

Overwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter from the company that gave players the saga of Azeroth, Starcraft and the Diablo universe. Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.

###The story and setting
Anyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.

###Continuous support
The game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/games/4ea/4ea507ceebeabb43edbc09468f5aaac6.jpg', true, false, NULL);

Each trap or spell costs the in-game currency you earn by defeating enemies. At the beginning of the level, you choose up to ten items for the battle.

###Gameplay
Deceit is heavily influenced by the Trouble In Terrorist Town Half-Life 2 mod. All six players spawn on a vast map, with several of your group being infected with a virus that allows them to transform in their terror form. The players have to figure out who is infected, kill them or at least attempt an escape.

Most of the time, the map is lit up by portable lamps and projectors, yet there are blackout periods that last several minutes. During these periods, the infected players can transform into the terror form in which they become faster, stronger, and have night vision. They can only be countered using light.

For the non-infected players, there are several objectives placed around the map, like turning on the generators, finding light sources or weapons. These objectives both increase the chance of player survival and sometimes allow the players to escape off the map.

After the EDF took down the Ultron Corporation, a new tyrannical regime was established soon after.  Alec Mason comes to the red planet in search for work and to see his brother.

Alec learns about an underground resistance group called Red Faction and joins them to seek revenge for his brother.

###Gameplay
The players have to complete a wide range of missions in the game''s singleplayer mode. These missions can be taken in whichever order the players see fit. There are six districts present on the planet.

The game''s world is highly interactive with the players being able to bring every building they want down thanks to an advanced physics model. This feature is used a lot in the game, as many quests will have Mason demolishing administration buildings, infrastructure and so on.

Duke restores his health over time using a new mechanic of “ego bar” — a measurement of Duke’s enormous ego that needs to be bolstered.

About the Game

Clothing, hairstyles, beards and tattoos of the hero influence how others perceive the hero. For example, light clothing causes benevolence, and dark - fear.

Of course, the attitude towards the hero is influenced by his actions. The proportion of good and evil acts affects his appearance.

The Protagonist controls his three newly found friends in battles against three opponents on a small arena. Each team has its own pyre. Both pyres oppose each other. The objective of the game is to defend your pyre while attacking the enemy one. The player can only destroy the pyre with the orb, that is spawned in the center of the arena and which has to be grabbed and thrown into the pyre.

During a round, the Reader can switch between the character he wants to control and pass the orb from one to another. Each player has their own amount of endurance which is required for moving around the arena. If the players of a team come together, they create a zone that is dangerous for the player that carries the orb. If the player with the orb should get into that zone, they''ll be temporarily removed from the game.

###Plot
The plot follows a player-created character in the world of Forgotten Realms, mainly in the location known as the Sword Coast. Set out on a quest for vengeance and resolving a crisis, the hero finds many friends and enemies, and ultimately, reveals his origin and the circumstances of the game’s introduction.

###Gameplay
The player can choose from different classes and in-game races, each with their advantages and disadvantages, and equip the corresponding gear to utilize the character’s skills of choice further. The role-playing system in the game is rich with dialogues and interactions with NPCs, as they often provide valuable information, quests or items. Combat in Baldur’s Gate is made through real-time actions and planning in pause mode, allowing players to create different strategies for more tough encounters.

###New in enhanced edition
The remake brought various bugfixes and overhauls for current-gen gaming systems, allowing for bigger screen resolutions and overall higher quality of graphics while retaining the key gameplay features. New NPCs and related quests, as well as an expansion pack, were added to Enhanced Edition, and new difficulty levels were implemented, either for players who only want to immerse in the story, or those who prefer a real challenge to their skills.', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/games/313/3136687fb0b34490d082b7272a0868e2.jpg', true, false, NULL);

Space Engineers allows a lot of options for customization, and the game’s code is open source, making it popular among modders.
The player assumes control over the human protagonist in a space suit and, at some stages of the game, an exploration ship (with options for both first and third person view). The player can build a variety of structures using different types of blocks and tools. Available structures include ships, planetary outposts, and space stations.
The game includes a campaign and a set of standalone scenarios. Each of the scenarios, in turn, can be played in “Creative” or “Survival” mode. The former is an easy sandbox in which the player is not limited in resources and cannot die.

You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.
Manage colonists'' moods, needs, wounds, and illnesses.
Fashion structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, or futuristic materials.
Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.

Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.
RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.
Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.
Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.
Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they''ll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.
The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert plain, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.
You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.
People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they''re too stressed, they might lash out or break down.
Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters'' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer''s leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino''s horn, and it''s much less dangerous.
You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he''ll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.
And there''s much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community. Read more at http://rimworldgame.com.

###Gameplay
The game can take place at any time starting from the late Middle Age to the Napolean Wars era. The player can control any country there is in the game. It is possible to choose any starting date from November 11th, 1444 to January 1st, 1821.

The player controls every aspect of life in his country. Diplomacy, religion (with each religion having its own development system), trading, science, and exploring the new lands (such as the Americas, Africa, and Australia). The player also has the country''s military under their control. Every aspect of that time''s society falls totally under the control of the player. You can build a new colonial superpower, become a dictator, establish a total dictatorship, or create a prosperous, democratic trade empire.

There is no clear objective in the game. Instead, it is set by the player. However, the developers try to guide the player into playing certain scenarios by using the in-game achievement system. For example, one of the game''s achievements is to unite Italy.

It is also possible to transfer the progress from another game made by Paradox Interactive, Crusader Kings 2, to Europa Universalis IV.', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/games/eff/eff7b309ae98c32b48f22a10e7523106.jpg', true, false, NULL);

The player’s goal is to complete quests that will earn his or her character the titular king’s bounty, be it gold or a rank in nobility.

Your class (warrior, paladin, or magician) is assigned automatically based on your actions in the tutorial mission. There are also dialogues, character interaction, and even romance options than allow your character to marry and have children. The player explores the world’s map in real time, like in most RPGs. The combat system, however, is completely different. During battles, the player controls not the hero, but the hero''s units, the number of which depends on the character’s “Leadership”.

The player still has two weapons (one main and one temporary) and can perform combos. For the first time in the series, the Prince does not have his swords, and a dagger is used instead (replaced with the Dagger of Time later). The temporary weapons now have a certain amount of damage they can sustain.

The Prince can now transform into a Dark Prince, whose health goes down quickly, but can be instantly regenerated with sand.
